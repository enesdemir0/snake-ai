#  Sanek AI â€“ Snake Game with Reinforcement Learning

Sanek is an AI-powered Snake game built entirely from scratch using Python. The snake learns how to play by itself using Q-learning and a simple custom-built neural network. The project includes real-time training, model evaluation, and gameplay visualization using Pygame.

## Project Highlights

- Q-learning with neural network (no external ML libraries)
- Self-learning snake with auto-restart after game over
- Automatically saves best model and score
- Evaluate and compare all saved models
- Visual training evolution and snake gameplay demo
